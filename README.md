# Modeling Perceptual Loudness of Piano Tone: Theory and Applications
This is the official code repository of the paper:
> Modeling Perceptual Loudenss of Piano Tone: Theory and Applications, ISMIR 2022

## Data for Training
Please download the piano tone recordings and calculated mel-spectrograms (in npy) of  both Environment I & II from [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B_CHz-z1XW34FMeQ8PbqwzyYPAwBWXCF?usp=sharing).

Then place it under the data folder:
